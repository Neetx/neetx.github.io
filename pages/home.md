**Hello h4ck3rz!**

```bash
unknown@unknown$ whoami

```

I'm a Master degree student in computer security at the University of Bari "Aldo Moro".<br>

My major interests:

- Security (system, low level and hardware stuff)
- Embedded systems and electronics
- Machine Learning

My secondary interests ( may I call them hobby? :) ):

- Information theory and formal methods
- Functional Programming
- Quantum Computing

My focus areas are **exploit development** and **reverse engineering**, 
in fact this website will be a collection of my works and experiments in
these topics.

Some publications will be my notes about somethings, in this case I will 
indicate the references of the ideas and concepts.
