**Hello h4ck3rz!**

```bash
unknown@unknown$ whoami
neetx
```

I'am another freaky security researcher<br>

My major interests:

- Userspace / Kernelspace Exploitation
- Operating System internals
- Reverse engineering
- Vulnerability research

But I have a lot of hobbies too.. computer science is awesome!

This website will be a very not exaustive collection of my personal
works and experiments.

Some publications will be my notes about somethings, in this case I will 
indicate the references of the ideas and concepts.
